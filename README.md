# OnlineQuranRecitorinPython
This is a commandline quran recitor which plays quran aya mp3s from online

This project is a commandline implementaton of quran recitor.


uses aya wise mp3 and ogg  collections on internet which are used by other quran softwares like zekr

it uses python-vlc module to stream on line mp3


it asks the sura number as input...


pause and stop is not implemented... I just close the terminal :)


I implemented my favorite recitor Saud Shuraim in ogg

* How to implement other recitors

1. Browse to any aya collection (works with even offline collection )
2. Change the path in the for loop


* Probable improvements

- A gui
- Adding recitation as in zekr
- Pause and stop

     Unfortunately my python knowledge is not enough...
